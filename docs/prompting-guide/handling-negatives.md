# 4. Handling Negatives ‚õî

Learn how to use negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements and guide PODgram.ai away from generating content you don't want. Master this technique to gain precise control over your creations.

## What Are Negative Prompts?

**Negative prompts** tell the AI what **NOT** to include in your image. They're like giving instructions to avoid certain elements, colors, styles, or concepts.

Think of it as the difference between:
- **Positive prompt**: *"Please include a sunny sky"*
- **Negative prompt**: *"Please don't include any clouds"*

## How to Use Negative Prompts

In PODgram.ai, you can access negative prompts through the **More options** menu when setting up your generation. Simply add words or phrases that describe what you want to avoid.

### **Basic Syntax**
Simply list the elements you want to avoid, separated by commas:

```
text, words, signature, watermark
```

### **Effective Negative Prompt Examples**

**For clean product photos**:
```
cluttered background, distracting elements, text, logos, people
```

**For professional headshots**:
```
casual clothing, messy hair, poor lighting, blur, distortion
```

**For minimalist designs**:
```
busy patterns, multiple colors, complex details, ornate decorations
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balancing Positive and Negative

### **The 80/20 Rule**
- **80%** of your effort should focus on positive descriptions
- **20%** should be negative prompts for fine-tuning

### **Don't Over-Negate**
Too many negative prompts can confuse the AI or make results generic.

**Good balance**:
```
Positive: Elegant wedding invitation design with floral borders and the text: "Sarah & John" in script font, cream and gold colors

Negative: modern, minimalist, dark colors
```

**Over-negated**:
```
Positive: Wedding invitation

Negative: modern, minimalist, dark colors, geometric, sans-serif, bold, bright, neon, simple, plain, digital, computerized, technical
```

### **When Positive Beats Negative**

Instead of using negatives, sometimes it's better to be more specific with positives:

**Instead of**: *"No modern style"*
**Try**: *"Vintage Victorian style, ornate, classic, traditional"*

**Instead of**: *"No bright colors"*  
**Try**: *"Muted earth tones, soft pastels, subdued colors"*
