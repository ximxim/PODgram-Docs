# 3. Prompt Structure üèóÔ∏è

Learn how to organize your prompts for maximum effectiveness. A well-structured prompt is like a well-organized blueprint ‚Äì it helps PODgram.ai understand exactly what you want to create.

## The Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt

Think of your prompt as a recipe with specific ingredients in the right order:

### **Formula for Success**

```
[MAIN SUBJECT] + [KEY DETAILS] + [STYLE/MOOD] + [TECHNICAL SPECS]
```

**Example breakdown**:
```
A golden retriever puppy [SUBJECT] 
wearing a red bandana, sitting in a flower field [DETAILS]
watercolor painting style, soft pastels, whimsical mood [STYLE]
high quality, detailed, commercial use [TECHNICAL]
```

## üéØ The 4-Layer Approach

This is what your image is fundamentally about.

**Examples**:

### **Layer 2: Essential Details**
The key characteristics that make your subject specific.

- *"in lotus pose on a beach at sunrise"*

### **Layer 3: Style & Atmosphere**

**Examples**:
- *"painted in impressionist style with soft brush strokes"*
- *"modern minimalist design, clean lines"*

## üé® Advanced Structuring Techniques

### **The Sandwich Method**
Place your most important elements at the beginning AND end of your prompt.

```
[CRITICAL ELEMENT] + [supporting details] + [style information] + [CRITICAL ELEMENT reinforcement]
```

**Example**:
```
Professional business logo + featuring an eagle in flight with the text: "Soar Consulting" + modern clean design, blue and silver colors + corporate professional branding
```

### **Priority Weighting**
Use specific language to emphasize what matters most.

**High priority phrases**:
- *"focus on..."*
- *"emphasize..."*
- *"primary element..."*
- *"most important..."*

**Example**:
```
A nature landscape, focus on dramatic storm clouds over ocean waves, emphasize the contrast between dark sky and white foam, moody atmosphere, cinematic lighting
```

### **Negative Space Planning**
Specify what should NOT be in your image early in the prompt.

```
A minimalist bedroom interior, NO clutter, NO bright colors, emphasize clean lines and neutral tones, scandinavian style, peaceful atmosphere
```

## üí° Structure Optimization Tips

### **Word Order Matters**
AI reads left-to-right, giving more weight to earlier words.

**Better**: *"A majestic eagle soaring through mountain valleys"*
**Worse**: *"Mountain valleys with an eagle that's majestic and soaring"*

### **Use Comma Separation**
Help AI parse different concepts clearly.

**Good structure**:
```
Vintage motorcycle, red paint with chrome details, parked outside 1950s diner, warm evening light, nostalgic atmosphere
```

### **Avoid Contradictions**
Don't fight yourself within the same prompt.

**Contradictory**: *"Modern vintage style"* ‚ùå
**Clear**: *"Modern interpretation of vintage aesthetics"* ‚úÖ

### **Be Proportionally Descriptive**
Spend more words on what matters most.

If the text is crucial (like for a logo), dedicate more prompt space to text details:
```
Professional law firm logo with the text: "Sterling & Associates" in elegant serif font, gold lettering on navy blue background, sophisticated typography with subtle legal scales icon
```
