## üö® Top 10 Common Pitfalls

### **1. Vague Subject Descriptions**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"A nice logo"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"A professional fitness gym logo featuring a mountain silhouette with the text: 'Peak Performance' in bold typography"*

**Why it matters**: The AI needs specific direction to create something unique and useful.

### **2. Forgetting Quotation Marks for Text**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Logo with Mountain Coffee text"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Logo with the text: 'Mountain Coffee' in rustic serif font"*

**Why it matters**: Without quotes, the AI might not render the text at all or might misinterpret it.

### **3. Conflicting Style Instructions**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Modern vintage minimalist complex design"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Modern interpretation of vintage aesthetics, clean minimalist approach"*

**Why it matters**: Contradictory instructions confuse the AI and lead to muddled results.

### **4. Overloading with Too Many Elements**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Logo with mountains, coffee cup, text, sunrise, trees, and vintage car"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Coffee shop logo featuring mountain silhouette with the text: 'Mountain Brew'"*

**Why it matters**: Too many elements create cluttered, unfocused designs.

### **5. Ignoring Intended Use Case**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Beautiful landscape"* (for a t-shirt design)
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Mountain landscape graphic suitable for t-shirt printing, bold silhouette, two colors maximum"*

**Why it matters**: Different products have different requirements for successful design.

### **6. Using Copyrighted References**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Logo like Nike swoosh but for coffee"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Dynamic curved element suggesting coffee steam, original corporate design"*

**Why it matters**: Copyright issues can limit commercial use of your designs.

### **7. Inadequate Color Specification**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Colorful design"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Earth tone color palette with sage green and warm brown accents"*

**Why it matters**: Specific color guidance ensures consistent brand-appropriate results.

### **8. Missing Technical Requirements**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Professional photo"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"Professional product photography, studio lighting, high resolution, commercial use"*

**Why it matters**: Technical specs ensure your images meet professional standards.

### **9. Unclear Text Placement**

**‚ùå Problem**: *"Put 'Coffee Shop' somewhere"*
**‚úÖ Fix**: *"The text: 'Coffee Shop' centered at the bottom in bold sans-serif font"*

**Why it matters**: Precise placement instructions create better composition.

### **10. Not Testing Variations**

**‚ùå Problem**: Using the exact same prompt repeatedly
**‚úÖ Fix**: Testing slight variations to find the best approach

**Why it matters**: Iteration leads to optimization and better final results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques

### **The Isolation Method**
When results are inconsistent, isolate each element:

**Step 1**: Test the core subject alone
```
"Mountain silhouette"
```

**Step 2**: Add one element at a time
```
"Mountain silhouette with coffee cup"
"Mountain silhouette with coffee cup and the text: 'Peak Brew'"
```

**Step 3**: Fine-tune each addition
```
"Mountain silhouette with coffee cup and the text: 'Peak Brew' in serif font"
```

### **The Comparison Method**
Generate similar prompts with small variations:

**Version A**: *"Coffee shop logo, rustic style"*
**Version B**: *"Coffee shop logo, vintage rustic style"*
**Version C**: *"Coffee shop logo, modern rustic style"*

Compare results to understand what works best.

### **The Reference Method**
When struggling with style, use reference descriptions:

**Instead of**: *"Cool style"*
**Try**: *"1960s poster art style, bold typography, high contrast colors"*

## üí° Pro Tips for Consistent Success

### **Build a Personal Prompt Library**
Document successful prompts and their variations:

```
‚úÖ WORKS: "Professional tech logo with the text: '[NAME]' in sans-serif font, blue and silver colors, clean modern design"

‚úÖ WORKS: "T-shirt graphic, mountain silhouette, vector style, two colors, centered composition"

‚ùå AVOID: "Complex detailed logos with gradients" (doesn't scale well)
```

### **Use the "Goldilocks Principle"**
Find the "just right" balance:
- **Too little detail**: Generic, bland results
- **Too much detail**: Cluttered, confused results  
- **Just right**: Specific enough for uniqueness, simple enough for clarity

### **Master the Iteration Process**
1. **Start simple** - basic concept
2. **Add specificity** - key details  
3. **Refine style** - aesthetic direction
4. **Polish technical** - quality specs
5. **Test variations** - slight modifications
