## üèóÔ∏è Prompt Structure Best Practices

### The Ideal Prompt Order

1. **Main subject** first
2. **Key details** second  
3. **Style and mood** third
4. **Technical specs** last

**Example**:
```
A majestic mountain landscape [subject] with snow-capped peaks and a crystal lake [details], painted in watercolor style with soft pastels [style], natural lighting, high resolution [technical]
```

### Detail Layering

Start simple and add complexity:

**Layer 1**: *"A coffee cup"*
**Layer 2**: *"A steaming coffee cup on a wooden table"*
**Layer 3**: *"A steaming coffee cup on a rustic wooden table, morning light streaming through a window"*
**Layer 4**: *"A steaming coffee cup on a rustic wooden table, golden morning light streaming through a caf√© window, cozy atmosphere, shallow depth of field"*

### Language That Works

**Use descriptive adjectives**:
- *"vibrant"*, *"soft"*, *"dramatic"*, *"subtle"*
- *"rustic"*, *"modern"*, *"vintage"*, *"futuristic"*

**Include sensory details**:
- *"warm sunlight"*, *"cool shadows"*, *"gentle breeze"*
- *"smooth texture"*, *"rough surface"*, *"glossy finish"*

**Specify quality and mood**:
- *"professional"*, *"artistic"*, *"commercial"*, *"editorial"*
- *"peaceful"*, *"energetic"*, *"mysterious"*, *"joyful"*
