# Text and Typography

One of the areas in which PODgram.ai excels is in the generation and integration of text into an image. Whether as an overlay (e.g. a meme), as a typographic design (e.g. a t-shirt design) or as an integral part of various image elements (e.g. the name of a bottle of perfume), it's easy to get good results, often on the very first try.

To do this, all you need to do is write your prompt using complete sentences and punctuation, and indicate the text to be written by putting it in quotation marks and describing the context.

Here's an example:

**Prompt**: _A poster on a wall with text that reads: "Everything you can imagine is real. – Pablo Picasso"_

The AI generated the requested text on a poster, on a wall.

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Pablo Picasso Quote Poster"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/1.png"
    imageAlt="Poster on wall with Pablo Picasso quote"
    prompt="A poster on a wall with text that reads: 'Everything you can imagine is real. – Pablo Picasso'"
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

In the image above, the AI has decided on the style and type of wall and poster that will be generated, as well as other visual aspects. Of course, you can describe these or any other elements you'd like to appear in the image yourself in the prompt, and the AI will generate them accordingly.

For the time being, text that you would like to be written using a non-Latin alphabet or accented Latin characters may have some difficulty being generated correctly, if at all.

## Various types of text renderings

As you will see in the examples below, PODgram.ai can easily integrate text in just about any situation.

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Simple text"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/2.avif"
    imageAlt="Simple text example"
    prompt="A striking image split in three, where on the left part, a minimalist set of three black geometric forms are arranged vertically on a light grey background. The center and right parts are united as a black background, a block of geometric text emphasizes the essence of minimalism: 'Keep it simple, experience minimalism.'"

  <ImageCard
    title="Text as logo"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/3.avif"
    imageAlt="Text as logo example"
    prompt="A striking photograph in which a jug of orange juice is placed on a patio table with a glass of orange juice next to it and a few oranges placed neatly on the table some cut in half. At the bottom of the image, the side of a wooden crate full of oranges shows the brand logo, which consists of a big orange in the background of the word 'Biorange' in stylish juicy/liquid lettering, which forms the logo for the orange juice brand. The background is blurred and a little dark, but it looks as though the photo was taken outside, in the garden of a house, on a sunny day."

</ImageCardGrid>

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Text formed by objects"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/4.png"
    imageAlt="Text formed by objects"
    prompt="A striking photograph in which a glass of milk is placed on a wooden table. A splash of milk comes out of the glass, forming the word 'Milk' in a swirly manner just above the glass. The background is blurred but looks like a homely kitchen."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Text as part of an object"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/5.avif"
    imageAlt="Text as part of an object"
    prompt="A close-up detailed product photo of a vibrant and energetic baseball cap, featuring a stylish red panda embroidered emblem that exudes vitality. The cap is embroidered with the team's name, 'Red Panda,' displayed boldly in white bold script font below the sleek red panda design. The dynamic perspective and intense focus on the cap create a sense of high-spirited enthusiasm and team spirit."

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Text as design"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/6.avif"
    imageAlt="Text as design"
    prompt="A vibrant and playful illustration of 'Summer Lifestyle' set against a dark backdrop. The words are rendered in a whimsical, multi-colored font with splashes of pink, yellow, and green, perfectly capturing the essence of the season. Surrounding the text, a tropical paradise unfolds with palm trees swaying gently, a surfboard catching a wave, and a beach umbrella providing shade. A cocktail glass filled with a refreshing drink and a slice of lemon sits on the sand, while a beach ball and sunny skies complete the scene. The overall design exudes a laid-back, beach-themed vibe, with the bright colors and tropical motifs emphasizing the fun and carefree spirit of summer."

  <ImageCard
    title="Text as logo or design"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/7.avif"
    imageAlt="Text as logo or design"
    prompt="A captivating vintage-style calligraphy artwork featuring a woman's silhouette with intricately crafted hair, made up of elegant script that reads 'Take care of your hair naturally.' The brand name 'Herbal Shampoo' is gracefully written in a fine sans-serif font below the main text, with the word shampoo being smaller, adding a touch of elegance to the design. The soft off-white background enhances the rich, vintage feel of the piece, while the seamless flow of the text emphasizes the message and the silhouette's feminine grace."

Note how, in the examples above, there was no need to use Style Tags, not even the Typography one. Everything was indicated in the prompt.

## Fonts and styles

There are times when you would like to use a particular font or typographic style. Although it is not currently possible to specify a typeface by name, it is possible to describe certain stylistic properties in order to obtain a satisfactory result.

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Bold Sans-Serif"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/8.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in bold sans-serif typeface"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in bold sans-serif typeface, in black on white background."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Ultra Thin Sans-Serif"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/9.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in ultra thin sans-serif typeface"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in ultra thin sans-serif typeface, in black on white background."
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Serif Typeface"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/10.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in serif typeface"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in serif typeface, in black on white background."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Bauhaus Style"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/11.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in Bauhaus style typeface"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in thin rounded bauhaus style typeface, in black on a white background."
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Script with Flourishes"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/12.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in script typeface with flourishes"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in thin and refined formal script typeface with flourishes, in black on a white background."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="1960s Hippie Style"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/13.avif"
    imageAlt="Welcome text in 1960s hippie-style typeface"
    prompt="The word 'Welcome' written in an elongated and artistic 1960's hippie-style typeface, in black on white background."
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

Bear in mind that the AI will also do its best to find an appropriate font style or typography for the image it needs to render. The result will be even better if you activate the Magic Prompt function. Here are two examples:

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Birthday Card with Magic Prompt"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/14.avif"
    imageAlt="Whimsical birthday card with rabbit and Happy Birthday text"
    prompt="A delightful and whimsical birthday card illustration featuring an adorable rabbit, wearing a cute chef's hat and apron, proudly offering a sumptuous cake with lit candles on it. The rabbit's eyes sparkle with joy and the background is a pastel-colored dreamy garden with fluffy clouds and blooming flowers. The text 'Happy Birthday' is written in a playful, cursive font, adding a touch of cheerfulness to the overall design."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Cyberpunk with Magic Prompt"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/15.avif"
    imageAlt="Futuristic cyberpunk cityscape with New Horizons text"
    prompt="An expansive and futuristic cyberpunk cityscape, with towering skyscrapers and neon lights that stretch into the night. The word 'New Horizons' is prominently displayed in large, futuristic letters, signifying the beginning of a new era. The background features a holographic sky filled with multicolored clouds and a crescent moon. A few flying vehicles can be seen in the distance, adding to the bustling city atmosphere."
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

## Fonts and copyrights

It is important to know that PODgram.ai's AI doesn't use real fonts to generate images the same way you use font in your computer. To put it simply, the AI learns by looking at lots of different text images and how it looks and what are the actual styles. As it learns, it figures out how to make text that matches those different styles. So, when you ask it to make text, it uses what it's learned to make text that looks like it's from a specific style or font, even if it's not using that exact font.

## Errors and misspelled words or phrases

Although PODgram.ai excels at generating text in images, an image can sometimes contain a spelling error, a missing or extra word or letter. Depending on the nature of the error, it is possible to correct the situation in various ways.

* Simply regenerate your prompt again a few times and see if you get the text you want.
* Change some of the longer, more complex words for shorter synonyms.
* Use the Editor to modify the text, adding or deleting parts and then remix the image.
* Use the Typographic Style Tag with version 1.0 as it helps to achieve better results.
* Upload an image containing the desired text, which will serve as a starting point and composition source for the image to be created by remixing it.

It's a well-known fact that long, complex words and long sentences are harder to generate correctly than short, everyday words. But don't despair, it can be done with patience, and it will get easier as the AI is updated and gets better.

It is often easier to remix an image to fix the image content itself while keeping the text right rather than trying to remix to fix the text while keeping the rest of the image.

Here's an example on how to fix text with the editor:

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Step 1: Original Error"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/16.avif"
    imageAlt="Text with spelling error - doubled letter i in Martini"
    prompt="An example of an image where a word contains an error. The letter 'i' in Martini has been doubled by mistake."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Step 2: Editor Correction"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/17.avif"
    imageAlt="Using editor to paint over unwanted letter"
    prompt="In the editor, choose the background colour to paint over the unwanted letter. In addition, the question mark has also been removed to be redrawn closer to the last word."
  />
</ImageCardGrid>

<ImageCardGrid>
  <ImageCard
    title="Step 3: Manual Redraw"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/18.avif"
    imageAlt="Manually redrawn question mark"
    prompt="Now, the question mark as been redrawn. No need to be that precise but it is easier if the redrawn letters looks like what it should when remixing the modified image."
  />
  <ImageCard
    title="Step 4: Final Result"
    imageSrc="/img/typography/19.avif"
    imageAlt="Final corrected text after remixing"
    prompt="Here's the result. The modified image has been remixed with a high level of image strength (90/100) and the roughly drawn question mark has been integrated and smoothed to fit perfectly with the text."
