# Plans & Pricing

Welcome to PODgram.ai's simple and transparent pricing! We believe in making AI-powered creativity accessible to everyone, which is why we start you off with **free credits** to explore what's possible.

## Get Started for Free!

Every new user receives **$2 in free credits** when they first install PODgram.ai! That's enough to generate dozens of images and test all our amazing features before spending a dime.

## How Our Metered Usage Works

:::tip[Simple Pay-As-You-Go Pricing]

PODgram.ai uses a **credit-based system** that's super straightforward! Instead of monthly subscriptions or confusing tiers, you simply:

1. **Add credits** to your account when you need them
2. **Use credits** as you create (each command costs a small amount)
3. **Keep creating** until you're ready to add more credits

No expiring credits, no monthly commitments, no surprise bills! You're always in control of your spending. âœ¨
