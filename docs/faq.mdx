## ðŸ’³ Subscription/Billing

export const billingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I upgrade my free account to a paid subscription plan?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Upgrading is easy! You can upgrade your account through our <a href="/docs/plans">pricing page</a> or by using the <code>/upgrade</code> command directly in Discord. Choose from our Premium or Enterprise plans based on your needs. Payment is processed securely through Stripe, and your upgraded features will be available immediately after successful payment.</p>
        <p>Need help choosing the right plan? Check out our <a href="/docs/plans">Plans Comparison</a> to see which features are included with each tier.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "How do I cancel my subscription plan?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard or by contacting our <a href="/docs/support">support team</a>. When you cancel, you'll continue to have access to premium features until the end of your current billing period. After that, your account will automatically revert to the free tier with its associated limitations.</p>
        <p>No cancellation fees apply, and you can resubscribe at any time.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my generated content if I cancel my subscription plan?",
    answer: "All content you've generated remains accessible even after canceling your subscription. However, you'll lose access to premium features like advanced generation options, priority processing, and expanded usage limits. Your message history and previously generated content will remain available in your Discord server as regular Discord messages."
  },
  {
    question: "Do my unused generation credits roll over to the next month if I don't use them?",
    answer: "Credit rollover depends on your subscription plan. Free tier credits reset monthly and do not roll over. Premium plan subscribers get partial rollover (up to 50% of unused credits), while Enterprise customers enjoy full credit rollover with no expiration. Check your plan details for specific rollover policies and limits."
  },
  {
    question: "I changed my mind. Can I get a refund on my subscription payment?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions. If you're not satisfied with your premium features, contact our <a href="/docs/support">support team</a> within 14 days of your purchase for a full refund. Refunds for subsequent billing cycles are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>Please note that refunds are only available for direct subscriptions and may not apply to promotional or discounted plans.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I update my billing details and view my invoices?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>You can manage all your billing information through your account dashboard. Access your <a href="/account/billing">billing settings</a> to update payment methods, view invoice history, and manage subscription details. You'll also receive email notifications for successful payments and invoice receipts.</p>
        <p>If you need assistance with billing, our <a href="/docs/support">support team</a> is here to help.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "How do I avoid being double charged when upgrading my plan or changing my plan to annual billing?",
    answer: "When you upgrade or change your billing cycle, we use prorated billing to ensure you're only charged for what you use. If you upgrade mid-cycle, you'll only pay the difference for the remaining period. When switching to annual billing, any unused time from your monthly plan is credited toward your annual subscription. Our billing system automatically handles these calculations to prevent double charging."
  },
  {
    question: "Why was I charged another month's subscription fee when I only wanted to subscribe for one month?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>All subscriptions automatically renew to ensure uninterrupted service. If you intended to subscribe for only one month, you can cancel your subscription immediately after signing up - you'll still have access to premium features for the full billing period you paid for, but the subscription won't renew.</p>
        <p>To avoid future charges, visit your <a href="/account/billing">billing settings</a> and cancel auto-renewal, or contact our <a href="/docs/support">support team</a> for assistance.</p>
      </>
