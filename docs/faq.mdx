    question: "How does PODgram.ai's credit system work?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          PODgram.ai uses a simple pay-as-you-go credit system with no
          subscriptions or monthly commitments! Each service (like image
          generation, background removal, or vectorization) costs a small amount
          of credits per use. You simply add credits to your account when you
          need them and use them as you create.
        </p>
        <p>
          New users start with <strong>$2 in free credits</strong> to explore
          all our features. After that, you can add any amount you'd like
          whenever you need more. Check out our{" "}
          <a href="/plans">Plans & Pricing</a> page for detailed pricing on each
          service.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do my credits expire?",
    answer:
      "No! Your credits never expire. There are no monthly resets, no rollover limits, and no time pressure to use them. Add credits whenever you want and use them at your own pace. This means you have complete control over your spending with no wasted money on unused subscription time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I add more credits to my account?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Adding credits is quick and easy! Just use the <code>/balance</code>{" "}
          command in Discord, choose how much you'd like to add (we offer preset
          amounts of $10, $25, and $50, plus a custom amount option), then click
          "Pay with Stripe" to complete your secure checkout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your payment is processed, you'll receive a confirmation message
          in Discord and your credits will be available immediately. For a
          step-by-step guide with screenshots, visit our{" "}
          <a href="/plans">Plans & Pricing</a> page.
        </p>

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund on purchased credits?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          We offer refunds on a case-by-case basis for unused credits. If you're
          not satisfied with PODgram.ai or made a purchase by mistake, please
          contact our <a href="/support">support team</a> as soon as possible.
          We're happy to help!
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that credits that have already been used for generating
          images or other services cannot be refunded, as these represent actual
          API costs we've incurred on your behalf.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I view my purchase history and receipts?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          All credit purchases are processed through Stripe, and you'll receive
          email receipts for every transaction. You can also view your payment
          history and download invoices through your Stripe customer portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check your current credit balance at any time, simply run the{" "}
          <code>/balance</code> command in Discord. If you need help accessing
          your receipts or have billing questions, our{" "}
          <a href="/support">support team</a> is here to assist you.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I run out of credits?",
    answer:
      "If your credit balance reaches zero, you won't be able to use PODgram.ai's services until you add more credits. Don't worry though - all your previously generated content remains accessible in your Discord server, and your account stays active. Simply add more credits using the /balance command whenever you're ready to continue creating!",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees or recurring charges?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely not! PODgram.ai has no subscriptions, no monthly fees, and no recurring charges. You only pay when you choose to add credits to your account. There are no surprise bills, no auto-renewals, and no commitments. You're always in complete control of your spending.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I check my current credit balance?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Checking your balance is simple! Just use the <code>/balance</code>{" "}
          command in any Discord channel where PODgram.ai is available. You'll
          see your current credit balance displayed, along with quick buttons to
          add more credits if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can check your balance as often as you like - there's no limit or
          cost to using the <code>/balance</code> command.
        </p>
