# üé® Edit

The Edit feature empowers you to modify and refine your generated images using natural language prompts. Whether you want to add elements, change colors, adjust details, or transform your design, the Edit feature makes it easy to iterate until you achieve the perfect result.

## üéØ How to Use

After generating images with the [`/imagine`](/features/imagine-command) command, you can edit any of your images with these simple steps:

### Step 1: Select and Click Edit

1. Use the **Image** dropdown selector to choose which generated image you want to edit (by default, Image 1 is selected)
2. Click the **"Edit"** button to open the editing modal

<img src="/img/features/edit/1.png" alt="Selecting an image and clicking Edit button" style={{maxWidth: '365px', width: '100%'}} />

### Step 2: Describe Your Changes

A modal will appear asking "What would you like to change?" Simply describe your desired modifications in natural language.

{/* HTML used here for max-width styling which cannot be achieved with markdown */}
<img src="/img/features/edit/2.png" alt="Edit modal with prompt input field" style={{maxWidth: '365px', width: '100%'}} />

**Example prompts:**
- "Put a beautiful butterfly on the dog's nose. The dog should be looking at the butterfly"
- "Change the background to a beach sunset"
- "Make the text bold and add a shadow effect"
- "Add sunglasses to the character"
- "Change all blue colors to purple"

Once you've entered your prompt, click **Submit** to process your edit.

## ‚ú® Result

Within seconds, you'll receive your edited image with the changes applied based on your prompt:

{/* HTML used here for max-width styling which cannot be achieved with markdown */}
<img src="/img/features/edit/3.png" alt="Edited image with changes applied" style={{maxWidth: '365px', width: '100%'}} />

The result message will show:
- Your edited image with modifications applied
- The prompt that was used for editing
- Credits used for the operation
- Your remaining balance

### Continue Iterating

Not quite perfect? No problem! You can continue editing by clicking the **Edit** button again. Each edit builds upon the previous version, allowing you to refine your design iteratively until you're completely satisfied.

### Additional Actions

After editing, you can perform additional actions on your image:
- **üîç [Analyze](/features/analyze)** - Get detailed insights and product recommendations
- **‚ú® [Vectorize](/features/vectorize)** - Convert to scalable vector format
- **üñºÔ∏è [Remove Background](/features/remove-bg)** - Create transparent PNG
- **üé® Edit** - Make further modifications (iterate again!)

## üí° Pro Tips

:::tip Be Specific and Clear
The more specific your editing prompt, the better the results. Instead of "make it better," try "add a red border around the text" or "brighten the colors by 20%."
:::

:::tip Iterate Gradually
Make one or two changes at a time rather than requesting many changes at once. This gives you more control over the final result and makes it easier to achieve your vision.
:::

:::tip Preserve What You Like
If you want to keep most of the image but change one element, be specific about what to change while being clear about what to keep. For example: "Keep everything the same but add a crown on the character's head."
:::

:::tip Build on Previous Edits
Each edit builds on the last one, so you can progressively refine your design. Start with major changes first, then fine-tune with smaller edits.
