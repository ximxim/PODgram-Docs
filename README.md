Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's how this Discord bot works for non-technical users:

## What is POD Bot?

POD Bot is your AI-powered assistant for creating print-on-demand artwork. It lives inside Discord and helps you generate professional images that you can sell on t-shirts, mugs, posters, and other products.

## How It Works

**ðŸ’­ Describe What You Want**
- Type `/imagine` followed by your idea (like "cute cat wearing sunglasses")  
- The bot uses AI to create multiple unique images from your description

**ðŸŽ¨ Perfect Your Images**  
After generating images, you get clickable buttons to:
- **Remove backgrounds** - Makes images transparent for better product placement
- **Analyze images** - Checks if your image is suitable for selling (copyright-safe, appropriate content)
- **Vectorize images** - Converts to high-quality format that scales perfectly

**ðŸ’° Pay-As-You-Go**
- New users get $2 in free credits to start
- Each action costs a small amount:
  - Generate images: $0.50
  - Remove background: $0.04  
  - Analyze image: $0.01
  - Vectorize image: $0.52
- Check your balance anytime with `/balance`
- Add more credits when needed through built-in payment buttons

**ðŸš€ Simple Commands**
- `/help` - See what the bot can do
- `/balance` - Check your credits and add more funds
- `/imagine [your idea]` - Create AI artwork

The bot handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes, so you just focus on being creative. It's like having a professional graphic designer that works instantly at a fraction of the cost!
